# BoP Trader

## What is BoP Trader?
BoP Trader is a mock trading system consisting of various cryptocurrencies.

## How does BoP Trader work?
Users create an account and go right to their personalized dashboard. Users are initially provided a set amount of money to use in the market of their choice. After spending the money in the market of their choice, the user can follow the price fluctuation and have the ability to continue to watch the prices, buy, or sell their currency. The application continues to work without the user being online and it constantly monitors the userâ€™s monetary income/loss depending on their actions. Trade capital for coin and vice versa. Want to see how one of your previous transactions turned out? Check out the transaction history in your Dashboard. BoP Trader is your one stop shop for paper trading crypto currency.
